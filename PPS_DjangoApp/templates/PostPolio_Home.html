            <h4>What is Post-Polio Syndrome?</h4>
            <p>Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS) is a secondary result of having had an acute paralytic viral poliomyelitis
                infection earlier in life. It appears to occur in between 25 and 60 percent (depending on which study is
                referenced) of Polio Survivors, and is characterized by symptoms of increasing weakness/loss of function
                in muscle groups previously affected by the acute infection, severe and/or sudden fatigue (often
                requiring unusually long recovery periods), and problems with deterioration of posture, balance,
                breathing, and/or swallowing.</p>
